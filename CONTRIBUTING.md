## Getting started with Fider codebase

Before start working on something that you intend to send a Pull Request, make sure there's an [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/tombull/teamdream/issues) open for that. If you're working on something not tracked yet, please open a new Issue before the Pull Request. If you have any question or need any help, leave a comment on the issue and we'll try our best to help you.

Fider is written in Go (backend) and TypeScript (frontend), but we also use things like Node.js, React and PostgreSQL.
If you know these technologies or would like to learn them, lucky you! This is the right place!

#### 1. Install the following tools:

| Software    | How to install                                                 | What is it used for                                       |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Go 1.13+    | https://golang.org/                                            | To compile server side code                               |
| Node.js 12+ | https://nodejs.org/ or run `nvm use` if you have nvm installed | To compile TypeScript and bundle all the client side code |
| Docker      | https://www.docker.com/                                        | To start local PostgreSQL instances                       |

#### 2. To setup your development workspace:

1. clone the repository.
2. navigate into the cloned repository.
3. run `go install github.com/cosmtrek/air` to install air, a cli tool for live reload, when you change the code, it automatically recompiles the application.
4. run `go install github.com/joho/godotenv/cmd/godotenv` to install godotenv, a cli tool to load environment variables from a `.env` so that you don't have to change your machine environment variables.
5. run `go install github.com/magefile/mage` to install mage, a cross-platform Make alternative.
6. run `go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint` to install golangci-lint, a linter for Go apps.
7. run `npm install` to install client side packages.
8. run `docker-compose up -d` to start a local PostgreSQL database and Local SMTP (with [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog)) on Docker.
9. run `cp .example.env .env` to create a local environment configuration file.

- **Important:** Fider has a strong dependency on an email delivery service. For easier local development, the docker-compose file already provides
  a fake SMTP server running at port **1026** and a UI (to check sent emails) at http://localhost:8026. The `.example.env` is already
  configured to use it. If you want to, you can edit `.env` file and configure the `EMAIL_*` environment variables with your own SMTP server
  details. If you don't have an SMTP server, you can either sign up for a [Mailgun account](https://www.mailgun.com/) (it's Free) or sign
  up for a [Mailtrap account](https://mailtrap.io), which is a free SMTP mocking server. If you prefer not to setup an email service, keep
  an eye on the server logs. Sometimes it's necessary to navigate to some URLs that are only sent by email, but are also written to the logs.

#### 3. To start the application

1. run `mage watch` to start the application on watch mode. The application will be reloaded every time a file is changed. Alternatively, it's also possible to start Fider by running `mage build` and `mage run`.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` and ðŸŽ‰! You should see the sign up page of Fider!

#### 4. To run the unit tests:

1. run `mage test` to run both UI and Server unit tests.

## Common Issues

#### 1. It doesn't work on Windows

This is a known [Issue #434](https://github.com/tombull/teamdream/issues/434). If you're a Windows user and want to contribute to Fider, please help us resolve this.

#### 2. godotenv: not found

This happens when godotenv was not (or incorrectly) installed. Install it by running `go get github.com/joho/godotenv/cmd/godotenv/`.

#### 3. mage watch throws 'too many open files' error

macOS has a small limit on how many files can be open at the same time. This limit is usually OK for most users, but developers tools usuage require a larger limit. [Learn how to resolve this](https://www.macobserver.com/tips/deep-dive/evade-macos-many-open-files-error-pushing-limits/).

#### 4. mage isn't found even after installing

Include %GOPATH%\bin in PATH environment variable and restart the terminal
